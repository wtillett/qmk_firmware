 * @file speculative_hold.h
 * @brief Speculative Hold module
 *
 * @note Speculative Hold is now a core QMK feature! See
 * <https://docs.qmk.fm/tap_hold#speculative-hold>
 *
 * With Speculative Hold, the hold function on mod-tap keys is activate
 * immediately on key down. Then depending on how the mod-tap key is settled,
 * the hold action is canceled (when the mod-tap is being tapped) or allowed to
 * continue (when the mod-tap is being held).
 *
 * "Speculative" holding behavior is useful to remove the input lag that
 * mod-tap keys normally have. An acute case is when using a mod-tap with an
 * external mouse to perform Ctrl + click, as this would normally require
 * waiting out the tapping term. With Speculative Hold, the mod is activated
 * immediately.
 *
 * By default, Speculative Hold applies to mod-tap keys where the mod is a Ctrl
 * or Shift mod. Define the get_speculative_hold() callback to customize this
 * behavior.
 *
 *
 * For full documentation, see
 * <https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/speculative-hold>
